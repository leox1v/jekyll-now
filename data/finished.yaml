#     - page: xv
#       content: But as I  look back, it seems clear to me that I learned the
#         most essential things not from my school teachers, nor even from my
#         university professors, but from my parents, who knew nothing at all
#         about science, in the single far-off year of 1939.

#       content: When, through indifference, inattention, incompetence, or fear

#       content: "Maybe people untalented in getting along with others find a

#         If we're absolutely sure that our beliefs are right, and those
